SmartIndent: An Online Purchase Requisition and Inventory Management System
To address the challenges of manual inventory management at CSIR CEERI, I developed SmartIndent, a comprehensive digital solution to streamline inventory tracking and procurement processes for scientists. By implementing this system, I contributed 90% to enhancing the existing manual workflow, transforming it into a modern, efficient, and user-friendly digital platform. The system offers the following key features:

Features and Functionalities:
Scientist Profiles with Personalized Inventory Lists

Each scientist has a dedicated profile linked to their inventory using foreign key relationships in the database. This ensures secure and personalized management of inventory data.
Email Notifications for Account Creation

Scientists receive an email confirmation upon signing up or logging in, implemented using an SMTP server for seamless communication.
Supplier Management

Suppliers, referred to as the store, manage stock orders and deliveries. The system maintains records of suppliers and tracks stock procurement.
GST-Compliant Bills

Readily printable GST invoices are generated for each inventory transaction, ensuring compliance and ease of record-keeping.
Digitalized Indent Forms

Traditional paper-based indent forms have been replaced with a digital workflow:
Scientists fill in their requirements and submit the form.
Store personnel review the requests, update stock availability, and approve or reject the requests.
Once approved, the updated form is sent back to the scientist, creating a seamless and efficient approval process.
Downloadable Indent Forms

A feature has been implemented to allow scientists to download the typed indent forms as PDF files. By clicking a "Download" button, users can easily save and print the forms for offline use.
User Dashboards

A customized dashboard is available for each user, created using JavaScript and Bootstrap. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface to view and manage inventory, requests, and notifications efficiently.
Technical Highlights:
Database Integration: Efficient data exchange between scientists and the store is enabled through a robust database structure.
Automated Workflows: Requests and approvals are automated to minimize delays and reduce human error.
User Experience: The digital interface simplifies inventory management, ensuring ease of use for scientists and store personnel.
Impact:
Transitioned CSIR CEERI's inventory management from manual to digital, significantly reducing paperwork and improving efficiency.
Enabled real-time tracking and management of inventory, enhancing transparency and accountability.
Introduced new features like downloadable indent forms and personalized dashboards to improve user experience and accessibility.
Contributed 90% to enhancing the existing workflow, bringing a transformative improvement to CSIR CEERI's operational efficiency.
